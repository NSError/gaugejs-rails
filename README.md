A short gem to inject [gauge.js](https://github.com/bernii/gauge.js)
into your Rails 3.1+ Asset Pipeline.

Using Sprockets, just include the library:

    /*= require gauge.coffee # require the coffeescript version
     *= require gauge.js     # or perhaps you want the straight JS?
     *= require gauge.min.js # minified? we got that, too
     */

Uses gauge.js version `ae0e45a4bdee00c2286d061efa1c21d97d34599a`.
